AgroTech Manual Testing Project

This repository contains the complete manual testing documentation for my AgroTech project. AgroTech is a platform created to help farmers with crop guidance, marketplace features for buying and selling agricultural products, and basic disease detection support.

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my skills in manual testing, test case design, defect reporting, and documentation.



## About the Project

AgroTech is designed with the goal of supporting farmers by providing:

* A marketplace to list or purchase agricultural products
* Crop guidance with detailed information
* A simple disease detection module
* User authentication features
* Profile management
* A clean dashboard for navigation

I tested the application from a user’s perspective to ensure its functionality, usability, and stability.



##What’s Included in This Repository

###1. Test Cases 

I have created 50 test cases covering major modules of the application. These include:

* Login
* Signup
* Marketplace (Buy and Sell features)
* Crop guidance
* Disease detection
* Profile management
* Dashboard
* UI/UX elements
* General navigation

The test cases include positive, negative, functional, and UI-related scenarios.

##Testing Approach

I followed a functional manual testing approach. I tested features based on:

* Application requirements
* User flows
* Boundary conditions
* Negative test scenarios
* UI and visual checks
* Browser-level behavior

I also performed light regression testing to ensure changes did not affect working features.

## Purpose of This Repository

This project demonstrates my ability to:

* Understand application workflows
* Design structured test cases
* Identify bugs effectively
* Document defects clearly
* Perform functional and UI testing
* Present QA work professionally

It is created as part of my learning and for showcasing my QA skills to recruiters and organizations.
